This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`) that demonstrates a full pipeline for classifying resumes (CVs) into categories using a CNN-based text classifier built with TensorFlow/Keras, plus a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for semantic search using SentenceTransformers and FAISS.
